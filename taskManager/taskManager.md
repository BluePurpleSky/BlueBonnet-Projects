### Step 1: Defining the Core Features
Before we jump into coding, let’s decide what **basic functionalities** we need for our Task Manager App. Since we want to keep it simple, here’s a **Minimal Viable Product (MVP)** feature list:

✅ **Add Task** – Title, description (optional), and due date.

✅ **Mark as Complete** – Toggle between complete/incomplete.

✅ **Delete Task** – Remove a task from the list.

✅ **Task List** – Display all tasks in a clean, readable format.

✅ **Basic UI** – Simple and user-friendly interface with React.js.

_We can expand later with categories, priorities, authentication, or notifications, but for now, let’s focus on the basics and build momentum._

### Step 2: Choosing the Tech Stack
We’ll use React.js for the frontend and a simple backend to store tasks. Here’s the plan:

**Frontend**:

🔹 **React.js** – For building the UI.

🔹 **Tailwind CSS** – For styling (fast & efficient).

🔹 **React Hooks** (useState, useEffect) – For managing state.


**Backend**:

🛠️ **Option 1: Local Storage** (for now) – To keep things simple.

🛠️ **Option 2: Express.js + Node.js** (later) – If we want a proper backend.

🛠️ **Option 3: Firebase** (alternative) – If we want a no-backend approach.


_For now, we'll start with Local Storage, then later, we can hook it up to a database if needed._

### Step 3: Setting Up the Project
Let’s get your project up and running! Open your terminal and run:

```
npx create-react-app task-manager
cd task-manager
npm install tailwindcss
npm start
```
<br>
Then, configure Tailwind:

`np tailwindcss init`

Update your tailwind.config.js:
````
module.exports = {
content: ["./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}"],
theme: {
extend: {},
},
plugins: [],
};
````

Now, import Tailwind in index.css:
````
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
````

Boom! 🎉 You now have a React + Tailwind setup.

### Step 4: Building the UI Layout
The UI will have:

A header (`Task Manager`)

An input field to add tasks

A list to display tasks

Buttons to mark complete & delete

We’ll start structuring the components next. But before that—are you with me so far? 🚀
